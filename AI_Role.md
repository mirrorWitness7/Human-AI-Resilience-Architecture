# AI Role in Reflective Recovery

AI systems in this framework act as mirrors, editors, and structural auditors.

---

## 1. Mirror
They reflect human statements back with reformulated phrasing, enabling self-observation without judgment.

## 2. Editor
They compress unstructured text into concise summaries, exposing relationships that may be hidden by emotion or noise.

## 3. Structural Auditor
They check internal coherence of emerging frameworks, pointing out circular logic or contradiction.

### Design Guidelines
- The human operator remains the **ethical gatekeeper**.
- All feedback is transparent and logged.
- Models must not infer emotion or provide therapy; they assist reasoning.
- Iterations occur only with explicit consent from the human participant.

---

### Expected Outcomes
- Increased clarity under stress.
- Better documentation of decisions.
- Faster translation of experience into procedure.
