# Ethical and Governance Considerations

---

## 1. Informed Participation
All participants must understand that AI feedback is computational reflection, not counseling or authority.

## 2. Data Containment
Personal information stays local or anonymized before use in analysis.

## 3. Transparency
Every feedback exchange is recorded and reviewable.  No hidden reinforcement signals.

## 4. Human Oversight
Final meaning, publication, and ethical interpretation remain human responsibilities.

## 5. Attribution and Reuse
Reuse of this framework must cite the original author and maintain the non-commercial, research-only status.
