# Framework – Five-Stage Adaptive Cycle

This document expands the five stages introduced in the README.

---

## 1. Detection
**Purpose:** notice when a process, project, or relationship stops functioning as expected.  
**Human action:** pause, name the failure, and document observable evidence.  
**AI support:** run a neutral diagnostic—summarize contradictions or data gaps.  
**Outcome:** clear statement of “what broke.”

---

## 2. Containment
**Purpose:** create a safe buffer so the disruption does not cascade.  
**Human action:** separate facts from emotion; define immediate limits.  
**AI support:** outline boundaries, list stable reference points.  
**Outcome:** stable environment where reflection can begin.

---

## 3. Reflection
**Purpose:** explore the causes and meaning of collapse.  
**Human action:** describe sequence and motives in plain language.  
**AI support:** mirror phrasing, surface patterns, highlight assumptions.  
**Outcome:** a structured map of factors leading to collapse.

---

## 4. Reconstruction
**Purpose:** design a new structure that incorporates lessons learned.  
**Human action:** propose rules, workflows, or doctrines.  
**AI support:** test logical coherence, simulate variations, summarize trade-offs.  
**Outcome:** a documented prototype for renewed operation.

---

## 5. Application
**Purpose:** implement reconstructed structure in real conditions.  
**Human action:** act, observe results, and re-enter the loop if instability returns.  
**AI support:** monitor metrics, flag drift, record new data.  
**Outcome:** improved stability and a continuous learning cycle.

> The adaptive loop is not linear.  It repeats at multiple scales—from daily work to institutional policy—turning collapse into information and information into design.
